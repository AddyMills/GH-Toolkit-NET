cfd73bbf	"Although he has rarely used a pick, he prefers the grit from his hard, calloused finger tips and visualizes the strings as a heavy punching bag, Trujillo is best known as a finger-playin' bass monster whose dexterity, tones and attitude have seen him grace the bass of Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves and Ozzy Osbourne's band since his first professional work with Suicidal in 1989.  Growing up in the streets of 'Dogtown' (Venice Beach, CA), Trujillo heard everything, from Led Zeppelin to Motown with a chunk of funk in between. Joined with a love of surfing, Trujillo developed a rhythm and a vibe that saw him play with a variety of local bands until he met Mike Muir of Suicidal Tendencies via his high school buddy, Suicidal guitarist Rocky George. The two got on infamously well, and thus began a rich and fruitful relationship.  In the early '90s, he and Muir formed the funk-rockers Infectious Grooves, and then in the mid-'90s Trujillo joined up with Ozzy.  Rob's name first floated by the Metallicamp during Suicidal's supporting role on the Summer Shed tour of '94. When it was time to consider who could take on the bass full-time in Metallica, Rob was an obvious choice.  And so it was that on Thursday, February 24th 2003, Robert Trujillo walked into the HQ and saw Ulrich, Hammett and Hetfield immediately start applauding him.  Rob is the perfect fit, a calm, even-keeled man with experience and full bass props...and one of the nicest guys around. It all adds up to the 4th member, and an exciting new stage in Metallihistory."

8fb4fb50	"Born Marcus Fjorn Frettenshredder to Swedish Hippies, Marcus moved to the US as a young kid. His journey into the world of rock 'n' roll came as a vision to him after a fall from a tree - As he lay there, he saw spirited visions of stages and exotic locations, followed by the image of a white and gold glowing guitar. Since then he's studied the more metaphysical and hypernatural aspects of music and guitar playing in particular. It's been his life's pursuit to attain the status of Rock God."

8f75c8a2	"Born in San Francisco, and raised in the East Bay town of El Sobrante, he gained an interest in music from his brother Rick's extensive record collection, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and UFO. It all led to him properly picking up the guitar when he was 15.  After picking up a 1978 Fender Stratocaster, Kirk experimented with guitar parts to find his perfect sound before falling for a 1974 Gibson Flying V.  Kirk also co-founded Exodus and the East Bay thrashers crossed paths with Metallica twice, in late '82 and early '83, as a support act.  In April 1983, Kirk received a phone call from Metallica in New York to fly out and audition. Kirk got the money together for the flight, left California for the first time and arrived in the late afternoon to find three guys who were still waking up. They knew the fit was right despite the fact that nobody ever formally invited him to join.  A student of Joe Satriani, Kirk continues on a passage of guitar self-education that has taken him through many musical styles.  Kirk continues to bring not only a dazzling array of lead guitar parts to Metallica's music but also some savage rifferey."

a4014ceb	"Creeping Death is a song by Metallica and is the seventh track on their 1984 album Ride the Lightning. Written from the perspective of the Angel of Death it describes the Plague of the Firstborn (Exodus 12:29). Creeping Death is 6 minutes and 36 seconds long and is also Metallica's most frequently played song, having been played over 1100 times since 1983, more than any other Metallica song. It stands as a classic example of the band's thrash style, albeit slower than the Kill 'Em All material. The middle section, based around ominous chants of Die! set to a perilous phrygian-mode chord progression, is a fan participation staple during Metallica shows."

2eb4c872	Eddie Van Halen single-handedly changed the face of rock guitar and inspired countless guitarists. His technique is often copied but never duplicated. Eddie is the true Guitar Hero!
c3897c89	"Eddie Van Halen was commissioned by Quincy Jones to play guitar on the song 'Beat It,' from Michael Jackson's 1982 album, 'Thriller.'  He supposedly did not accept payment for his work on the track."
476225c7	"Eddie Van Halen's middle name, Lodewijk, the Dutch version of Ludwig, was inspired by classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven."
c72e4796	Eddie Van Halen's patented two-handed tapping and pull-off effects took electric guitar technique to new levels.
7a7fe8c2	"Eddie Van Halen, who was only 22 at the time of the recording, won his first of five consecutive 'Best Rock Guitarist of the Year' awards from the readers of Guitar Player magazine thanks to his performance on this album."
929d3e07	"Eddie achieved this Brown Sound by using his Frankenstein guitar, a stock 100-watt Marshall amp, and a Variac."
4bf34836	"Eddie and Alex Van Halen were raised in Pasadena, the children of Dutch immigrants who came to California in 1967."
7ea59a84	"Eddie has described the solo in this song as loose, fun, and crazy.  Eddie even felt that he played it better live than he did on the album."
4122bdba	"Eddie intentionally left a guitar solo out of the final version of the song, instead replacing it with a riff of Tap Harmonics."
cd8136e6	"Eddie played the synth parts of 'Jump' on his Oberheim OB-Xa, which were run through his Marshall amplifier."
8843a288	Eddie recorded 'Spanish Fly' using a nylon-string Ovation guitar.  It features incredibly fast picked riffs and a distinctive finger tapped ending which sends a barrage of notes at the listener.
4f8e2fe6	"Eddie starts the 'Panama' solo with an atypical bluesy style, but then progresses into vintage Eddie finger tapping along with use of the tremolo bar."
b8e6c929	"Eddie took electric guitar playing to a whole new level with his two-handed finger tapping, incredibly fast hammer-ons and pull-offs, and effects that mimicked animal and machine sounds."
b4d8267d	"Eddie used similar inspiration when he named his son, Wolfgang Van Halen, after the classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."
bbe0fa84	"Eddie uses a tapping technique where he holds notes on the lower part of the neck with his left hand, and then taps the same notes twelve frets higher with his right hand."
ee0cb53c	Eddie uses his index finger and thumb on his right hand to slap notes at the 12th fret while fretting notes with his left hand lower on the neck.
4e1e0eae	Eddie very rarely played the same solo twice on this song.
be333f05	"Eddie was lined up to play Fort Knox as the jewel in his touring crown, but cancelled last minute.  Instead, he played a charity event for poor sick orphans.  You see, he has a heart of gold..."
9e7598c6	Eddie was rehearsing for a Whiskey gig not knowing that Donn Landee was recording the now famous 'Eruption.'
baead59f	Eddie will regularly play parts of 'Cathedral' as part of his solo during live concerts.
6758d10c	Eddie wrote 'Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love' a year before their debut album 'Van Halen' was released.
d742cd6a	Eddie wrote the main riff for 'Unchained' when he and engineer Donn Landee were doing some late-night overdubbing for the 'Fair Warning' album.

72d1b030	"Eddie's ever ready to rock steady with a heady mix of rockabilly and reggae. His songs are dark and heavy, vocals range from breathy to Geddy, guitar is said to be pretty shreddy."
c8d5a526	"Eddie's keyboard playing is more prominent on '1984' than on any prior Van Halen album. It was featured heavily on 'Jump,' as well as 'I'll Wait,' and instrumental album-opener '1984.'"

be857b15	He also said that 'Tuesday's Gone' was very moving to him and being able to record the song with Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Gary Rossington was an honor.
6beb6105	He also said that Samhain was the original Halloween before the Christians took it over.
12cdd7ab	He even said he challenged himself to try and write riffs as good as that.
13ed2552	"He formed his first band, The Decibels, when he was only 15 years old."
37d122ba	He has also said it's a song he wishes they would play more often.
86625931	"He passed away on November 24, 1991 at the age of 45 from bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS."

3dbba165	"He's just like Superman, but he doesn't even fear kryptonite.  Ian Fraser Kilmister, known as Lemmy, is simply indestructible; a huge, iconic alliance of hell-raiser, cult-figure and rock-animal.  Ever since the mid '70s, he's been the one and only, the uber-persona of loud, hard and aggressive rock.  Eviscerating ears for a good three decades, Lemmy has never taken part in any commercial adventures or played the music-industry's twisted 'game'.  Lemmy has always done his thing, according to his own rules, and in his very own words. And it is this relentless boot-stomp forward which has carried the spirit of Motörhead, that heaviest of  metallic power-horses, on its full-bore, no letup 30 year career. Add to Lemmy the Welsh guitar-genius that is Philip Campbell, and the energetic flurry of skinsmanship that is Michael 'Mikkey Dee' Delaouglou on drums, and you have the baddest, meanest, leanest and strongest power trio in rock'n'roll today."

636a78ce	"If someone was ever named the President of Metallica, that would be crew guy Zach Harmon. For over 20 years he's been there to keep Metallica's gear together as the 'go-to guy' on the road and in the studio.  Zach grew up in Pasadena, CA and he and his brother befriended guys in East LA that formed the band Armored Saint in 1982. As an all around crew guy, Zach slugged his way through the decadence of the early 80's metal club scene with the Armored Saint gang.  Headbanging SoCal clubs & theatres, Saint made their way to San Francisco to open for Metallica in 1983 for 3 shows -the first of many to come. Zach kept driving a truck, setting up drums, tuning guitars, paying damage bills, setting off illegal pyro, all in the name of Metal!  Crazy times working and raging with bands in clubs & studios soon turned from fun hanging with your buddies to a paying gig.  Life on the road included a memorable Metal Church tour, a Metallica- Wasp- Armored Saint tour and being drum roadie for Metallica in 1985 at the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, CA.  Being a road crew member that worked with bands who supported Metallica and finally working full time for them was a ride most could not imagine.  Zach's path continued to cross Metallica's and he ended up with an open bunk on a Metallica tour bus to call home. Years later, Zach is fortunate to be included in the Metallica family."

1ca9d2e0	"King Diamond (born Kim Bendix Petersen, June 14, 1956, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a Grammy Award nominated heavy metal musician.  As a vocalist and frontman for both Mercyful Fate and King Diamond, he is known for his use of falsetto, mixed with a wide range of normal vocals, and often using his voice in a very theatrical way.  While Mercyful Fate's lyrics mostly have occult content, with his band King Diamond mainly concentrates on writing full concept horror stories.  King Diamond's latest album 'Give Me Your Soul...Please', released on June 26, 2007 received a Grammy nomination in the 'Best Metal Performance' category for the track 'Never Ending Hill'.  On August 9, 2008 he made an appearance at Ozzfest at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, TX alongside Metallica, performing a medley of Mercyful Fate songs previously released on Metallica's 'Garage Inc.' album.  On stage, Diamond uses a microphone handle consisting of a femur bone and a tibia bone in the shape of a cross.  The song 'Evil', which appears in this game, is a 2008 re-recording of the song by 4/5 of the original lineup, almost 25 years to the day of when it was first recorded (King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner, Timi Hansen and Bjarne Holm).  The original version of the song can be found on the Mercyful Fate album 'Melissa'."
e9baa996	King Diamond first got the idea to wear make-up after a performance by Alice Cooper in 1975.
2b657835	King Diamond has expressed his frustration that no matter what new record he makes it always gets compared to his 1987 album 'Abigail'.
2bcf3f7b	"King Diamond has joined Metallica and performed 'Mercyful Fate' a number of times including August 9, 2008 at The Ozzfest in Dallas, Texas."

Lars was nearly 10 when the sounds of Ritchie Blackmore and Deep Purple blew his socks off at the first gig he ever attended.  At 13 his grandmother bought him his first drum kit. When the family moved from Copenhagen, Denmark to Newport Beach, CA in 1980, he got so excited about European heavy metal music that he jammed with a young James Hetfield before taking a teenage trip to England during June of 1981 to see Diamond Head. He managed to finagle living with them for a while before returning to So Cal and tape-trading with the likes of Metal Blade Records' Brian Slagel.  Slagel was looking for local L.A. bands for a compilation album that would serve as the label's first release. Lars got a slot, but had no band. Remembering the less-than-awesome yet energetic jams with young Hetfield, Lars called him up again and told him about the album. James listened. And thus Metallica was conceived.  These days, some 100-odd million albums sold worldwide later, Metallica might have undergone enormous collective and individual changes, but the essence of Ulrich remains."

He was 9 years old when he first took piano lessons before taking on older brother David's drums and finally picking up a guitar in his pre-teens.  With the likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Thin Lizzy providing inspiration, James' dream was to be on stage in a band.  Soon he was jamming in a few party bands in high school with him on guitar/vocals, but when James met drummer Lars Ulrich, the rest as they say is history.  James is the main songwriter in Metallica, co-creating the framework and structure for their material.  When he's not writing, singing or playing, James enjoys building, driving and terrorizing neighbors with Kustom cars, hot rods and motorcycles.  James is happiest spending time with his wife Francesca and three children, Cali, Castor, and Marcella."

I deny.\n\nI blind my eyes and try to force it all into place.\nI stitch them up, see not my fall from grace.\nI blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by.\nI open just in time to say goodbye.\n\nAlmost like your life.\nAlmost like your endless fight.\nCurse the day is long.\nRealize you don't belong.\nDisconnect somehow\nNever stop the bleeding now.\nAlmost like your fight.\nAnd there it went,\nAlmost like your life.\n\nLike a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think.\nLike a raging river drowning when\nI only need a drink.\nLike a poison\nThat I swallow\n"

Uh-huh!\nAnd all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy\n\nHe needs some cool tunes not just any will suffice\nBut they didn't have Ice Cube so he bought Vanilla Ice\nNow cruising in his Pinto he sees homies as he pass\n"

Bands are ranked by the total number of points their members have at the end. If you miss a note, you'll earn a strike. 3 strikes, and you're out! ... until the next section.\n\nTip: Use Star Power to clear off strikes, and to prevent strikes in difficult sections.\n"

When the timer runs out, the player with the lowest individual score contribution is eliminated. The final elimination happens at the end of the song. The band with the last player remaining is the winner.\n\nTip: Band Moments and Star Power affect score dramatically.\n"
